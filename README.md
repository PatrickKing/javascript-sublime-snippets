# javascript-sublime-snippets
A bunch of javascript snippets for sublime text, tweaked to my preferences.

Put these in your Sublime Text `User` package folder. You can find that by using the 'Browse Packages...' option from the menu bar.

The 'catch' snippet is meant to work with Bluebird style error catchers, which filter by error type.
